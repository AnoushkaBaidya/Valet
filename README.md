Navigating in constrained and congested areas, particularly when it comes to parking, is one of the difficulties autonomous vehicles confront during path planning. To remedy this, a fictitious setting is made in which three cars must be parked in a constrained space. When determining a workable solution, path planners must take vehicle kinematics and collision avoidance into account. The goal is to execute path planning in intricate continuous spaces with various vehicle-specific kinematic restrictions. To do this, we take into account the kinematics of each vehicle and navigate the continuous space using state lattices. A skid drive robot, an Ackermann drive robot, and an Ackermann drive robot with a trailer are the three types of vehicles we investigate.

###  Environment Setup

The environment is a two-dimensional 200X200 grid size that has the following:

    ● It has 2 vehicles parked south of the grid with some space to park our ego vehicle in between.

    ● It has an obstacle which is a park in between the grid environment

A] Ego Vehicle
The ego vehicle is the centerpiece of the autonomous system and its actions are determined by the algorithms and decision-making processes implemented in the system.The controlled vehicle is required to adhere to the kinematic constraints while following the trajectory generated by the motion planner. The start position is at the northwest of the grid and the end position for our ego vehicle is between the vehicles parked south.

B] Obstacles
I have utilized three obstacles to create the environment, the first being a top-view image of a park which is a static obstacle. The other two obstacles are vehicles, between which my ego vehicle needs to be parked.

C] Planner
The planner used is Hybrid A* Algorithm

### Results 

A] Differential Drive Robot - Skid Drive
The path plot of the differential drive shows that the car begins its journey from the start position and moves towards the end location where it eventually stops. During the journey, the car makes slight adjustments to its steering to deflect from the obstacle that is the park, causing the path plot to be slightly curved towards the center. It can also be observed from the video that the robot accurately follows the differential kinematics and is able to park right at the position.

B] Ackerman Steering Robot
The path plot generated for Ackerman Steering displays the car starting from its initial position and smoothly maneuvering towards its goal, eventually coming to a stop. The path taken by the car is notably smoother in comparison to the previous trajectory. This is due to the car steering more accurately to avoid the obstacles in its path. However, towards the end of the path, the points on the trajectory appear to be clustered, which was not the case for the differential robot. This is because when the car reaches its goal, it has to orient itself slowly to align with the desired position, due to the steering and non-holonomic constraints imposed by the differential kinematics. The car moves back and forth while turning by smaller angles to finally achieve the desired orientation.

C] Ackerman Steering Robot Truck with a Trailer
The path plot generated for Ackerman Steering displays the car starting from its initial position and smoothly maneuvering towards its goal, eventually coming to a stop. To make it work, one of the obstacles is removed. It takes a roundabout path to safely drive to the goal position. It makes smooth turns and also deflects from the path to avoid the obstacles.
